# Inheritance
With **inheritance**, you'll create classes that absorbs existing classes' capabilities, then customize or enhance them. 
When creating a class, you can specify that the new class should **inherit** an existing class's members. This existing class is called the **base class**, and the new class is called the **derived class**.

This section uses an inheritance hierarchy of employee types in a company's payroll application to demonstrate the relationship beween base and derived classes
